HOW-TO Build
============
o Requirements for building WTP download tool for Linux:
1. The code has been built and tested on x86_64 architecture machine running Ubuntu 14.04.
2. The compiler used for biulding this code was g++ 4.8.2.

o Building instructions:
The tool was built using the command:
   make -f makefile.mk


HOW-TO Use
============
o UART downloading instructions:
The UART downloading procedure requires BootROM enters into UART R/W mode.
(See section - 'Escape sequence instructions' for details.)

1. UART downloading for non-secure boot
   UART image components:
	* TIM_ATF.bin
	* boot-image_h.bin
	* wtmi_h.bin
   UART download command:
	sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB<port #> clocal
	./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C <port #> -R 115200 -B TIM_ATF.bin -I wtmi_h.bin \
		-I boot-image_h.bin -E

2. Trusted Images
   UART image components:
	* TIM_ATF_TRUSTED.bin
	* TIMN_ATF_TRUSTED.bin
	* boot-image_h.bin
	* wtmi_h.bin
   UART download command:
	sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB<port #> clocal
	./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C <port #> -R 115200 -B TIM_ATF_TRUSTED.bin \
		-B TIMN_ATF_TRUSTED.bin -I wtmi_h.bin -I boot-image_h.bin -E

Notes:
1. WtpDownload application doesn't require 'sudoer' privilege over USB Serial port.
2. WtpDownload application requires to assign the userid to 'dailout' group access.
   (need re-login to take effect)
   sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>
3. Please refer to ATF - doc/mvebu/build.txt for the build command of UART images.
4. The UART image components are archieved in ATF - build/a3700/[release|debug]/uart-images.tgz.

o Escape sequence instrustions:
When working with a mal-functional bootloader in flash, WTP download tool can be used to
trap BootROM into UART R/W mode via UART port.

1. Press the 'RESET' button on your system and hold on.
2. Run the following command on your host machine and releaese the 'RESET' button in the
   meanwhile.
   sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB<port #> clocal
   ./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C <port #> -R 115200 -Y

o Combined instructions for UART downloading and escape sequence:
The WtpDownload application provides an option to execute escape sequence and UART downloading
in a single command.
	sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB<port #> clocal
	./WtpDownload_linux -P UART -C <port #> -R 115200 -B TIM_ATF.bin -I wtmi_h.bin \
		-I boot-image_h.bin -E -O
