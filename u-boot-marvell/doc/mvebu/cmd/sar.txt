SAR (Sample at Reset) commands
===============================
SAR commands are used to toggle the available Sample at Reset modes.

Notes:
- SAR commands are only relevant for Marvell boards that use EEPROM device.
- At first use, a reset should be done to SAR fields values with "sar default" command.
- In order to use SAR fields values a jumper should be in:
	- jumper 52 in a8040-db
	- jumper 38 in a7040-db
- After a SAR write command, a reset is required for the changes to take effect.

Examples
--------
- "sar list" - Get the list of possible fields.
- "sar list <field>" - Get the list of possible values for a specific field.
- "sar read" - Get the current values of all available SAR fields.
- "sar read <field>" - Get the current value of a specific SAR field.
- "sar write <field> <value>" - Set the required value for a specific field.
	- A reset is required after a SAR write command for the changes to
	  take effect.
- "sar default" - Reset all writable SAR fields back to their default values.
- "sar default <field>" - Reset SAR field back to his default value.

The list of the Sample At Reset possible fields and values is defined in the device tree.
