mg_boot command
===============================

mg_boot command allows to load MG CM3 firmware and emulate MG's CM3 UART

Introduced commands allows to load MG CM3 firmware into MG's CM3 SRAM and
release it from reset. The MG's CM3 doesn't have hardware UART but after
enabling CMD_MVEBU_MG_BOOT option, UART emulation can be used and console
input/output can be redirected to MG's CM3

The MG's CM3 UART emulation is done in the shared memory where both MG's CM3
and ARMv8 has access to. The CM3 instead of putting some characters into UART
registers, puts char into memory which can be read by ARMv8 U-Boot.

Receiving character from CM3 perspective: The CM3 polls some other part of
shared memory, if it finds some new chars it process it (instead of reading UART
register). Thanks to that, ARMv8 U-Boot can send some characters to this
shared memory and the CM3 will be able to receive and process them.

A complementary patch can be found in FreeRTOS github repo:
"a8k_mg: add uart emulation support"


parameters:
-----------
- remote_file_name - TFTP image path to be loaded to MG CM3 SRAM
- cp_nr - CPx number [0 | 1]
- io_redirect - redirect console IO to CM3 [0=no (deflt) | 1=yes]

Load the FreeRTOS firmware and switch to emulated MG's CM3 console:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Marvell>> mg_boot path/to/tftpfile/RTOSDemo-cm3-mg.bin 0 1
# Using egiga1 device
# TFTP from server 10.2.0.102; our IP address is 10.2.2.182
# Filename 'path/to/tftpfile/RTOSDemo-cm3-mg.bin'.
# Load address: 0xf2100000
# Loading: #############
# 	 1.3 MiB/s
# done
# Bytes transferred = 61801 (f169 hex)
# Opening MG CM3 console..
# 	Use "poweroff" for powerdown CM3 and falling back to u-boot prompt
# 	Use "exit" falling back to u-boot prompt (CM3 still runing)
#
#
# 	<some FreeRTOS log>

NOTE: Be aware that A8K MG's CM3 doesn't have hardware UART, therefore are
emulated console was prepared. After loading the CM3 firmware and using console
redirect (io_redirect set to 1), the emulated console of CM3 takes control over
A8K U-Boot's console.

The logs from CM3 are not printed in real time, they are buffered in shared
memory. To dump buffered log just:
- Press the 'Enter' key (this is needed to see logs that are buffered by FreeRTOS
  and they are not a direct result of entered command)
- Enter a command followed by 'Enter' key (this will dump log which is direct
  results of entered command)


Falling back to u-boot console:
-------------------------------

- To exit from it (and leave the CM3 running) do:
# MG-CM3>exit
- To exit and shutdown CM3 do:
# MG-CM3>poweroff

===============================================================================

mg_console
==========

mg_console command allows to switch console IO to CPn MG CM3. It is useful
in cases where:
- we run mg_boot without console IO redirection
- when we fall back to u-boot console but after some time we want to switch
  back console redirection to CPn MG CM3

parameters:
-----------
- cp_nr - CPx number [0 | 1]

Going back to MG CM3's console
------------------------------
If there is need to e.g. to check what is happening in CM3, we can go back to
it by running below command:

# Marvell>> mg_console 0

After we return, we can dump what was buffered by FreeRTOS as it was
described earlier by:
- Pressing the 'Enter' key (this is needed to see logs that are buffered by FreeRTOS)
- Enter new command followed by 'Enter' key (this will dump log which is direct
  results of entered command)
